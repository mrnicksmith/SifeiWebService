This simple project reads a zip file from a c:\sifei directory and then uses the getCFDI web service of Sifei
We are encountering problems where we get the message "El Comprobante no cumple con el estandar XML (Conforme al W3C) o con la estructura XML (XSD y complementos aplicables)"
regardless of what we try. Please provide a file that will work or let us know what we are doing wrong
